<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1 style="color:white;text-align: center;">Acquire Free D.I.E Machine Shockwave (Wonder Weapon)</h1>
<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Wait until the Megaton spawns and lure him to the back of Nacht. This is the pond area.<br> You will see a tree right as you enter the pond area coming from the Jugger-Nog perk machine.<br>This tree will have huge spores coming out of its bark.</p>
<img src="SporeTree.png">
<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Lure the Megaton towards this tree and wait for him to attack you using his super ability.<br>Stand behind or near the tree and make sure that the poison or fungus from the Megaton hits the spores.<br>The spores will now turn purple. You're done here for now.</p>
<img src="PurpleSporeTree.png">
<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">You can now kill the Megaton and it will split into two Megaton Blasters.<br>Kill both of them and the second blaster will drop a keycard.<br>It'll be easy to spot as it will be an ultra loot and glow yellow.</p>
<img src="Keycard.png">
<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Pick up the key and make your way to the Weapons Lab in the Facility.<br>In the Weapons Lab, you can use the Keycard on the Weapons Locker.<br>After using the Keycard, a drawer will open up, revealing a D.I.E Remote Control.<br>Pick it up and go to the Nacht living room near spawn.</p>
<img src="DIEshockwavedoor.png">
<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">There is a small room inside the living room next to the stairs.<br>There is a wonder weapon inside this room.<br>You can activate it as a trap when you stand on the right side of the room.<br>There is a crack in the wall and you can use the D.I.E Remote Control to activate it.</p>
<img src="DieTrapActivation.png">
<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Before activating, make sure you have a horde of around 30 zombies.<br>Activate the D.I.E Machine Shockwave and it will start sucking in through the vent above the door of the small room.<br>Ensure the zombies are passing through it, and their souls will get sucked into the D.I.E Machine Shockwave,<br>then you can activate it again to discharge and blow open the door.</p>
<img src="DieSucking.png">
<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">Go inside and you can pick up the base version of the D.I.E Wonder Weapon.</p>

<h1 style="color:white;text-align: center;">D.I.E Cryo-Emitter Upgrade (Ice Upgrade) </h1>
<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;text-align: center;">You can then pick up the wonder weapon and make your way to the roof of Nacht.<br> Halfway through, you will see a wooden box at the edge of the blown off Nacht roof.<br>Hit it with your wonder weapon, and it will fall near the tree where we lured the Megaton to hit earlier.</p>
